# Height-Weight-predictor
By analyzing the relationship between height and weight, this project aims to develop accurate predictive models that can be applied in various domains such as healthcare, nutrition, and public health. 
In real-world scenarios, understanding the height-weight relationship is crucial for several domains:

Healthcare: Physicians use height and weight measurements to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI), which is a key indicator of obesity and undernutrition. Accurate prediction models can help in assessing growth in children, diagnosing health conditions, and tailoring personalized healthcare plans.

Nutrition: Dietitians use height and weight to develop individualized diet plans. Predictive models can aid in recommending caloric intake and nutritional requirements based on an individual's height.

Fitness and Wellness: Fitness professionals utilize height and weight data to create customized fitness programs. Predictive tools can enhance these programs by providing more precise assessments of an individual's health and fitness needs.
